This is a web page that that helps you design other web pages. The idea is to keep the control in the hand of the programmer yet trying to reduce the amount of typing that one has to do when one needs to write cross browser html/css manually.

Basically, what I am trying to do is to store customized data on the DOM for each of the elements and then apply them to the elements when the user confirms the changes.

After you have designed the layout visually, the idea is to download the structure and the css of the page by selecting from a menu and then copy pasting it to your own html pages.

Since everythign works on the browser, dont make the mistake of refreshing the page especially after you have done a lot of work. Maybe later I would try to fix this problem using some more HTML 5 features, depending upon the time that I have at my hands, but as of now, just beware of the F5 button.
